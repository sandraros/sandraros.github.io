Welcome to the Quality SAP Q&A wiki!

I have created this wiki after Jelena initiated a [discussion](https://answers.sap.com/articles/12935170/repetitive-blog-posts.html) about the quality of SAP Community blog posts (many blog posts with duplicate content) and after the comment from Frederic about creating a hierarchy/structure of articles to quickly find the most valuable blog posts. I propose that this wiki also applies to questions and answers.

# Concept
This wiki will have:
* one page per question/answer,
* each question should be clear and concise, imply one small and clear answer, like StackExchange network spirit (for instance [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tour)),
* minimal text, i.e. repeated code or text should be in one dedicated page, and other pages should refer to it, code snippets should be minimal, like they shouldn't contain exception handling,
* generalize the text and code as far as possible, i.e. a basic ABAP code about reading a file should contain elements contained in all ABAP-based softwares (common to ERP, CRM, SRM, etc.),
* indicate the scope of validity,
* include references to the existing sources, i.e. don't repeat existing blog posts, just propose a quick abstract if needed and refer to the source,
* page titles should be precise so that the visitors look at a minimal number of pages before getting a satisfactory answer,
* the sidebar contains the home page,
* the footer contains a table of contents with major topics.
